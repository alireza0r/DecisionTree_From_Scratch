# DecisionTree_From_Scratch
<h1> Decision Tree with ID3 algorithm </h1>
<mark>Folders:</ mark><br />
Create_dataset:<br />
- In this folder us can make a .csv file of .discrete files<br />
- There is a Adult dataset in this folder and you can use of this dataset<br />
- for create .csv files of .discrete files you should run create_dataset.py<br />
- after run create_dataset.py, program get .discrete file name<br />
-	 Attention: The .discrete file must have the following labels:<br />
-	 Labels: dataset_headernames = ['label', 'workclass', 'education', 'marital-status', 'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'native-country'] <br />
- After run, create two train_dataset.csv and validation_dataset.csv<br />
<br />
<br />
Create_tree:<br />
- In this folder you can make a tree with ID3 algorithm<br />
- You should run ID3_withCheackLabel_csvDataset_v0.24.py<br />
- After run, you have to give a train dataset (.csv), for example you can use Create_dataset/train_dataset.csv or train_dataset.csv.<br />
- After train, The model make a tree_law.csv that show the tree law also make a train_full_information.txt that show a info dictionary of the dataset.<br />
<br />
<br />
Test_Tree:<br />
- you can use of this folder for test the Tree.<br />
